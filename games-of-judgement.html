          <p>Research into the psychology of human perception, inspired by reading Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, led us to an idea for a social game involving Facebook profile pictures, which was successfully pitched to the Channel 4 innovation fund 4iP.</p>

          <p>The premise of the game is that players attempt the correctly guess characteristic of strangers - including age, sexuality, relationship status and even whether they have a tattoo or not - based soley on their photo. This is, surprisingly, harder than it sounds.</p>

          <p>In return for opting their own profile picture into the game, players can learn a little about how other people judge them, allowing for a moment of reflection, as well as often being somewhat amusing.</p>

          <p>The data generated through the game also tells some interesting stories at aggregate level, revealing which types of people are better at guessing - and who perhaps rely a little too much on stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The game was launched on Facebook, and received press coverage in the Guardian and on games blogs.</p>
