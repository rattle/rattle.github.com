          <p>Originating as an obvious joke, Wordr was a Twitter clone with a new limitation: you could only post one word at a time. There's no stopping some people though, and we soon discovered that one word could say a lot.</p>

          <p>The rules of the site evolved gradually. Word length was limited to 28 characters (the length of antidisestablishmentarianism), and could be optionally followed by a question or exclamation mark. The addition of the ability to respond to other people's words enabled new games of verbal ping pong.</p>

          <p>A vocabulary cloud surfaced some of the interesting words people were using (often neologism and portmanteaus), although pleasingly 'tea' remained firmly at the top of the charts.</p>

          <p>The site attracted attention far and wide, and was even featured on TV as part of the BBC's Click programme.</p>

          <p>Wordr is now retired.</p>
